# StockTwits-Reader

### ** Under Development **
### The current version is written for a very specific research project. I will change this to be a complete package.

StockTwits-Reader structures and standardizes [StockTwits](https://stocktwits.com) Historical Database.


## What is StockTwits?
If you are here, you probably know [StockTwits](https://stocktwits.com): it is social media platform designed for sharing investing and trading ideas. If you are a developer, you may find [StockTwits API documentations](https://api.stocktwits.com/developers/docs) very helpful.


The current proejct is designed for accessing the historical datasets that are NOT available to the public. If you are interested (Maybe you are a researcher, or a journalist, etc.), you can request an individual license. If approved they will grant you access to their firehose.


**THIS PACKAGE DOES NOT GRANT YOU ACCESS TO HISTORICAL DATA**
